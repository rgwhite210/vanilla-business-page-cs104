# Vanilla Business Page – CS104

This project is intended for educational purposes only and does not represent a real business. This repository contains
a simple, static business website created as part of an introductory web development course (
CS104). The project aims to demonstrate foundational front-end concepts and responsive implementation.

# Project Overview

All content and design choices chosen by the Author were created specifically for this project. This project is a
fictional business website developed in stages as part of a web development course. Each phase builds on the previous
assignment to progressively introduce core front-end concepts.

### Phase 1: Static Homepage

The initial version focuses on building a single-page business homepage using semantic HTML and external CSS. It
includes a business logo image, an introductory section, a list of services, navigation links for future pages, and
basic styling for layout, colors, and typography.

### Phase 2: Multi-Page Layout & Accessibility

The second phase expands the site into a multi-page structure, including Home, Services, and Contact pages. A responsive
navigation bar is introduced, along with consistent styling across pages using external stylesheets. Web accessibility
best practices are applied, such as descriptive alt text for images and proper labeling of form elements.

### Phase 3: JavaScript Interactivity

The final phase enhances the website with JavaScript-based interactivity. Features include a dynamic image gallery on
the Services page, client-side form validation on the Contact page, and an interactive FAQ section. JavaScript and DOM
manipulation are used to update page content dynamically without full page reloads, while maintaining accessibility and
functionality standards.
