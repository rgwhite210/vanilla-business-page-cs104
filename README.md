# Vanilla Business Page – CS104

This repository contains a simple, static business website created as part of an introductory web development course (
CS104).

The project demonstrates foundational front-end concepts using **vanilla HTML and CSS**, including semantic HTML
structure, basic styling with CSS classes, and accessibility-conscious markup.

## Project Overview

The site represents a fictional business and was designed to practice:

- Proper HTML document structure
- Use of semantic elements (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
- External CSS for layout, colors, and typography
- Image usage with accessible `alt` text
- Basic page layout and visual hierarchy

All content and design choices were created specifically for this project.
