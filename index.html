<h1>Canine Companions</h1>

<h2>Pet Care <em>Matters</em></h2>
<p class="main">Canine Companions, LLC is a small, independent business built on loyalty, trust, and companionship. We
    focus on providing thoughtful, reliable dog care with a personal touch, treating every dog in our care like
    family.</p>

<h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
<p class="main">Canine Companions was inspired by Henrick and Raeya, our two very special dogs, who represent everything
    we love about canine companionship.</p>
<p class="main">Raeya is a true social butterfly. Friendly, outgoing, and always ready to make a new friend, she brings
    warmth and joy wherever she goes. Her playful spirit and gentle nature remind us how important connection, trust,
    and positive interactions are in a dog’s daily life.</p>
<p class="main">Henrick, on the other hand, is sweet, thoughtful, and a little shy. He’s a handsome boy with a calm
    presence, showing us that every dog has their own pace and personality. Henrick has taught us the importance of
    patience, understanding, and creating a safe, comfortable environment where dogs can feel secure and cared for.</p>
<p class="main">Together, Raeya and Henrick shaped our brand, logo, and mission. They inspire us to provide thoughtful,
    compassionate, and personalized care for dogs of all breeds and sizes. Whether your dog is outgoing like Raeya or
    more reserved like Henrick, we’re committed to giving them the attention, respect, and care they deserve...so you
    can have complete peace of mind.</p>
